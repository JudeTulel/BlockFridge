# BlockFridge

BlockFridge is a blockchain-powered smart fridge concept that ensures seamless, secure, and conditional payment for goods. With BlockFridge, users prepay for goods, and the funds are only released when the goods are physically taken from participating shops. The platform leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, accountability, and a smooth shopping experience.

## Problem Statement

Traditional payment systems for goods often lack transparency, involve high transaction fees, and are prone to disputes. Customers have limited control over their spending once funds are transferred, and shop owners face challenges with fraud and reconciliation. Additionally, current systems do not provide a reliable way to manage prepayments for goods, leading to inefficiencies and trust issues between customers and shops.

## Project Description

BlockFridge addresses these challenges by introducing a blockchain-based platform that:

1. **Empowers Users**: Allows customers to prepay for goods using tokenized credits, ensuring funds are only released upon physical collection of the items.
2. **Enhances Trust**: Builds transparency and accountability into transactions, benefiting both customers and shop owners.
3. **Simplifies Payments**: Utilizes fungible tokens for categories of goods, reducing transaction fees and disputes.
4. **Streamlines Shop Operations**: Provides a QR code-based system for shops to validate and process transactions seamlessly.

By integrating blockchain technology with user-friendly features, BlockFridge creates a secure, efficient, and transparent system for prepaid goods management.

## Example User Workflow

### Redeeming Tokens at Participating Till Numbers

1. **Prepay for Goods**:
   - The user logs into the BlockFridge app and purchases tokenized credits for specific items (e.g., bread tokens, onion tokens).
   - The purchased tokens are stored securely in the user's blockchain wallet.

2. **Visit a Participating Shop**:
   - The user goes to a shop partnered with BlockFridge and selects the desired goods.

3. **Scan QR Code at the Till**:
   - At the till, the shop assistant generates a QR code representing the goods the user is purchasing.
   - The user opens the BlockFridge app, scans the QR code, and confirms the transaction.

4. **Validate and Deduct Tokens**:
   - The app verifies the transaction details and ensures the user has sufficient tokens.
   - The corresponding tokens (e.g., 2 bread tokens, 1 onion token) are deducted from the user's wallet.

5. **Confirm Goods Collection**:
   - Upon successful deduction, the app notifies both the user and the shop.
   - The shop assistant hands over the goods to the user.

6. **Transaction Record**:
   - The blockchain records the transaction, ensuring transparency and providing a receipt for both parties.

This workflow ensures a seamless, secure, and efficient shopping experience while maintaining trust and accountability between users and shops.
